# Speed Terminal (Beta)

Typing speed test generator, powered by Wikipedia API. [Live Demo](https://speed-terminal.netlify.app/).

## Details

[Speed terminal](https://speed-terminal.netlify.app/) is a single-page **react** based project aimed to test your typing speed on a computer keyboard.

The app **doesn't have pages**, but instead every section is a **standalone window**, so navigating through the app is similar to navigating a computer: by opening, moving, minimizing or closing windows.

To **generate** a typing speed test click on **Start** the main menu, from there you can configure your test or just leave the defaults and click **start test** button.
ðŸŽ² **NOTE:** You can select specific topics by clicking **Topic** in **Generate Test** menu, which will open a popup window where you can fetch **Wikipedia** summery section of the topic you're interested in.

The app includes a **game mode** rendered using **WebGL** with the help of **Pixi.js**.
